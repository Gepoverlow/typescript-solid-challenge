# 4 Pillars of OOP

# Encapsulation

The definition of encapsulation is "the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule". Removing access to parts of your code and making things private is exactly what Encapsulation is all about (often times, people refer to it as data hiding).

# Polymorphism

In Object-Oriented Programming, Polymorphism allows you to perform the same operation in multiple ways. It enables you to invoke the same method with different JavaScript objects by passing selected data members.

# Abstraction

To abstract something away means to hide away the implementation details inside something â€“ sometimes a prototype, sometimes a function. So when you call the function you don't have to understand exactly what it is doing.

# Inheritance

Inheritance lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object. In JavaScript this is done by Prototypal Inheritance.

Reusability is the main benefit here. We know sometimes that multiple places need to do the same thing, and they need to do everything the same except for one small part. This is a problem inheritance can solve.
